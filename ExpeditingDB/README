This is a personal project that was created to scour a tree of folders for pdf files and construct an excel database.

The program was updated to essentially be more robust and versatile by not restricting which directories it could search and how deep it could dig.

The FileScrape class will pull the file name, the folder name, file path, folder path, and last modified date in array lists.  If additional folders exist, the program uses recursion to dig into each folder and repeat.

Calling the ExcelPackager class will package the package the file, folder, and last modified date into 3 columns in an excel file, with hyperlinks to each file and folder.

The next changes that need to be made are the following:
1. Possibly transitioning form ArrayLists to Hashmaps.
2. Adding a GUI interface.
