This is a personal project that was created to automate the construction of a database with data pulled from multiple sources.  The program is essentially broken up into 4 sections.

Section 1
An excel workbook and the necessary sheets and formatting helpers and setup here.

Section 2
A maintained access database already exists on the network, but unfortunately, there is some trouble accessing the file.  I believe this is due to security reasons.  The workaround is to copy and paste the file onto the local drive and access it from there.  The code then pulls data and writes it to the excel file.

Section 3
The code searches through a forest of folders and files located on the network and pulls the file name, modified date, and hyperlink to the file.

Section 4
Another forest of folders exists and the code does the same as section 3, but also adds in the folder name because valuable information is stored in there.

Everything is written to the excel file.  The proper formatting is applied and the file is closed.
